# Experiment artifact integrity

## Purpose

The repository-level `integrity/` suite detects when current code no longer
reproduces accepted experimental artifacts. It is primarily a refactoring safety
system: after changing shared capture, fitting, adapter, experiment,
data-preparation, or plotting code, run the relevant check before deciding that
the existing results remain current.

Accepted artifacts are references; the verifier never silently replaces them.
A mismatch means that downstream artifacts may be stale. It does not decide
whether the old or new behavior is scientifically correct. Investigate the
difference, then either preserve the previous behavior or deliberately rerun the
affected experiment and update its descendants.

The verifier is deliberately outside `src/icalens`. It invokes production code
where appropriate but independently selects references, compares outputs, writes
reports, and maps failures to artifact dependencies.

## Verification levels

- **Numerical replay:** current production logic is rerun on a natural retained
  input slice and compared numerically with an accepted output.
- **Aggregation replay:** accepted fine-grained measurements are inputs; current
  aggregation or collection logic must reproduce the accepted summary.
- **Identity preflight:** revisions, hashes, schemas, shapes, and configuration
  relations are checked, but numerical production is not rerun.
- **Assumed valid:** the artifact is a declared trust root whose producer cannot
  currently be reproduced.
- **Skipped:** no honest independent check is currently available.

Aggregation replay protects summarization, collection, and serialization. It
does not validate the model computation that produced the retained fine-grained
measurements. Keep this distinction visible in documentation and reports.

## Running the verifier

The model canaries are GPT-2 Small layer 6, Gemma 2 2B layer 13, and Qwen 3.5 9B
Base layer 16.

```bash
# Fast identity check for the default GPT-2 canary
uv run python -m integrity.run --check reference-preflight

# Shared ICA pipeline stages
uv run python -m integrity.run --model all --check capture
uv run python -m integrity.run --model all --check fit
uv run python -m integrity.run --model all --check profile

# Shared SAE adapter plus activation-pattern replay
uv run python -m integrity.run --model all --check sae

# Downstream experiments, twin data, and representative rendering
uv run python -m integrity.run --check downstream

# Every implemented check
uv run python -m integrity.run --model all --check all
```

Each operation prints a flushed `START` line, timestamp, final status, dependency
IDs, and elapsed time. Detailed output goes to its `runtime.log`. Reports are
stored under `integrity/runs/<source-fingerprint>/`; the fingerprint includes
committed, modified, and untracked files, so results from another workspace state
are not silently reused.

The runner accepts `--verbose`, tolerances, verification sample sizes, and
single-model reference overrides. See `uv run python -m integrity.run --help`.

## Trust boundaries and artifact graph

For `A --B--> C`, data `A` is consumed by code `B` to produce artifact `C`.
Verify upstream producers first. If `A` has passed and `C` changes, the evidence
points more strongly to `B`; if `A` has not passed, a downstream mismatch cannot
be localized confidently.

`--check downstream` writes current C14/C30 skip explanations to a temporary
file and prints its path. A skipped relation does not fail implemented checks,
but it must remain visible here.

## Interpreting failures

- C10 failure: downstream activation-based checks are inconclusive until capture
  is resolved.
- C11 failure with C10 passing: existing ICA Lenses and descendants may be stale.
- C12 failure with C10/C11 passing: investigate profiling, readout, or occurrence
  logic.
- C13 failure: every experiment using `SAEFeatureEncoder` may be stale.
- Experiment aggregation failure with shared inputs passing: investigate that
  experiment's collection, aggregation, or serialization.
- C40 failure with raw results passing: raw results may remain valid, but paper
  twin data may be stale.
- C41 failure with twin data passing: investigate plotting/style code; the raw
  experiment generally need not be rerun.

External revisions are trust roots only while their immutable identities match.
Never describe schema or aggregation validation as a replay of external API or
human judgments.

## Maintenance rules

1. Find the changed path's `C` ID and downstream `D` artifacts in this map.
2. Run upstream checks first, then the affected check, then C40/C41 when paper
   artifacts consume the result.
3. Use a meaningful natural slice already present in accepted artifacts. Do not
   require remembering to create a special pre-refactor baseline.
4. Compare intermediate identities and arrays as well as final means whenever
   retained artifacts permit it.
5. Never update an accepted reference merely to make a failure disappear.
6. If implementation work reveals an incorrect dependency, update this map in
   the same change.
7. Keep pilots outside the integrity gate unless they become accepted evidence.

Ordinary unit tests remain necessary, but they do not establish that accepted
experimental numbers are still reproducible.
