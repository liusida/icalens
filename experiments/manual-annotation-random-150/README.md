# Random 150-component manual-annotation sample

This experiment samples 50 ICA components from each base ICA Lens for GPT-2,
Gemma 2 2B, and Qwen3.5 9B. Sampling is uniform without replacement over all
available `(layer, component)` pairs within each model. The base seed is 0, and
a stable model-specific seed prevents model ordering from changing a sample.

Generate the recorded sample from the repository root:

```bash
uv run python experiments/manual-annotation-random-150/run.py
```

The selected layer and component IDs are stored in model-specific
`results/<model>/components.csv` files; complete sampling provenance is stored
in `results/sampling.json`. Existing outputs require `--force` to replace.

Build a single review page containing all 150 package-rendered component
profile panels:

```bash
uv run python experiments/manual-annotation-random-150/build_review.py
```

The combined page is written to `results/review.html`. It embeds the package's
profile-panel markup directly with one shared stylesheet; it does not use
iframes. Before rendering, the builder computes suffix-sweep ERF for every
sampled component through `lens.erf.suffix_sweep(...)`. Full results for all
five rank thresholds are cached under each model's `results/<model>/erf/`
directory. The card subtitle shows the top-15 mean suffix ERF. Existing valid
caches are reused; pass `--refresh-erf` to recompute them. Existing review
output requires `--force` to replace.

Initialize the top-level annotation record once with:

```bash
uv run python experiments/manual-annotation-random-150/create_annotations.py
```

This creates `annotations.json` with a blank label and `null` confidence for
each of the 150 sampled components and refuses to overwrite an existing
annotation file.

Fill blank labels for components whose cached top-15 mean suffix ERF is exactly
1.0 using their selected-tail top occurrence token, with surrounding whitespace
removed:

```bash
uv run python experiments/manual-annotation-random-150/autofill_erf1_labels.py
```

The command preserves every existing nonblank label.
