# ICA Lens

ICA Lens maps language-model activations into independent components with a
lightweight fitting process that is substantially more compute-efficient than
training an SAE dictionary. It provides a compact Python API for loading,
fitting, sharing, and applying ICA transformations to base and instruction-
tuned language models.

```bash
pip install icalens
```

```python
from icalens import ICALens

lens = ICALens.from_pretrained("sida/icalens-gpt2-small-pile10k")
result = lens.analyze("She deposited the check at the bank.", layer=6)

result
```

In Jupyter or Colab, `result` displays the interactive explorer inline. Use
`result.to_html("analysis.html")` to save it as a standalone file.

## What ICA Lens provides

- Fit ICA lenses on activations from base or instruction-tuned language models.
- Analyze raw text and multi-turn conversations at any fitted layer.
- Inspect signed component scores and per-token energy shares interactively.
- Label components using high-energy examples, Logit Lens tokens, and optional
  R-lens readouts.
- Save, load, and share lenses through local folders or Hugging Face Hub.
- Scale fitting to large token collections with bounded GPU and CPU memory.
